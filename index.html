    <p class="body-description">Alan Mathisan Turing was an English Computer Scientist, Mathematician, Logician, Cryptanalyst and Theoretical Biologist. He is considered by many to be the father of modern computer science as the world knows it. He formed the concept of the algorithms and computations with one of his inventions, the Turing Machine.</p>
    <p class="body-description">Turing carried out the research during the war at Bletchley Park undoubtedly shortened the conflict and saved thousands of lives. Turing's work helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine. He also contributed some more fundamental work on codebreaking that was only released to public scrutiny in April 2012.

          <p>The Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses.

        <!-- Chess Algorithm -->
        <div class="contribution-list-item" id="cbt-list-item-4">
          <p>Alan Turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program in 1953. Turing first worked on the algorithm in 1948[123] The program did not run on a computer; Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard. According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess."
          </p>
          <p>Turing used chess-playing as an example of what a computer could do. Along with David Champernowne he specified a chess playing algorithm, implemented as "paper machine" dubbed Turochamp. Since there was no machine yet that could execute the instructions, he did himself, acting as a human CPU requiring more than half an hour per move. One game is recorded, which Turing's "paper machine" lost to one of his colleagues [15], Alick Glennie. At the University of Manchester, Turing began programming Turochamp, as well as Michie's and Wylie's program Machiavelli, to run on a Ferranti Mark 1 computer, but could not complete them.

    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-heartbeat timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1912 : BORN</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Born in Maida Vale, London on June 23rd. Parents are Ethel Sara Turing and Julius Mathison Turing.</p>

      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-child timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1918 - 1926 : EARLY EDUCATION</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators.
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">In 1922, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex. Learned to play chess at the age of ten.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-heart-o timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1926 : CHRISTOPHER MORCOM</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with.
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship between them provided inspiration for Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-gratipay timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1930 : CHRISTOPHER'S DEATH</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Turing's first love, Christopher Morcom, died in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's mild some years previously.
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">"I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do."
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">
Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-book timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1931 : COLLEGE</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.

      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1936 : STUDIES</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.

      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1938 : Ph. D</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Turing obtained his PhD in June 1938 from Princeton. His dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.

        <i class="fa fa-minus-circle timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1952 : APPALLING TREATMENT</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for being gay, when homosexual behaviour was still a criminal act in the UK.
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">He had been arrested after having an affair with a 19-year-old Manchester man. He accepted treatment with oestrogen injections (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison.
        </p>
        <p class="timeline-description">The conviction meant he lost his security clearance and had to stop the code-cracking work that had proved vital to the Allies in World War Two.

        <i class="fa fa-hourglass-end timeline-icon"><span class="timeline-yeartag">1954 : TRAGIC DEATH</span></i>
        <p class="timeline-description">Turing died on June 7th 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, and his body was found on June 8th in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium.</p>
